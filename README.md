## Key Business Rules & Constraints

1. **User-Role Mapping**: Each user has exactly one role; manufacturers and suppliers link to user accounts
2. **Ingredient Ownership**: Suppliers own and define ingredients (same name can exist across suppliers as different ingredient_ids)
3. **One-Level Composition**: Materials in FORMULATION_MATERIAL cannot themselves have materials (enforced by application logic)
4. **Lot Format**: Enforced by triggers (ingredientId-supplierId-batchId for ingredients, productId-manufacturerId-batchId for products)
5. **90-Day Rule**: Ingredient expiration must be ≥ 90 days from received date
6. **Batch Size Multiple**: Product batches must be integer multiples of standard_batch_size
7. **Access Control**: Users can only work with entities they own based on role
8. **Active Formulations**: Selected by date range (no overlapping periods per ingredient)
9. **Active Recipes**: Only one active recipe plan per product at a time

## Key Relationships Summary

- **USER** → **MANUFACTURER/SUPPLIER** (1:1, role-based)
- **SUPPLIER** → **INGREDIENT** (1:many, ownership)
- **MANUFACTURER** → **PRODUCT** (1:many, ownership)
- **PRODUCT** → **RECIPE_PLAN** (1:many, versioned)
- **INGREDIENT** → **FORMULATION** (1:many, versioned pricing)
- **FORMULATION** → **FORMULATION_MATERIAL** (1:many, compound composition)
- **INGREDIENT** → **INGREDIENT_BATCH** (1:many, physical lots)
- **PRODUCT** → **PRODUCT_BATCH** (1:many, production lots)
- **PRODUCT_BATCH** ↔ **INGREDIENT_BATCH** (many:many via BATCH_CONSUMPTION, traceability)

This structure properly handles supplier-owned ingredient definitions, user authentication, and complete traceability as specified in the requirements.

# CSC440 Project - Short Report: Modeling Choices and Query Reasoning

## Key Modeling Decisions

**User System**: Implemented separate USER entity with role field linking to MANUFACTURER/SUPPLIER entities. This supports the "Login → Select role" flow in Appendix A while enforcing the "one role per user" constraint.

**Supplier-Owned Ingredients**: INGREDIENT entity includes supplier_id as owner because suppliers "Define/Update Ingredient" per functional requirements. Same ingredient names can exist across different suppliers as distinct entities.

**Versioned Formulations**: Separate FORMULATION entity handles pricing and effective dates while keeping core ingredient definition stable. Supports "versioned formulations" with "non-overlapping effective periods."

**Recipe Versioning**: Used explicit version numbers with is_active flag rather than date-based selection because requirements state "the plan used in production is selected explicitly."

**Lot Number Format**: VARCHAR primary keys with format "ingredientId-supplierId-batchId" enforced by triggers for required traceability.

**Batch Consumption**: Bridge entity BATCH_CONSUMPTION captures "exactly which ingredient lots were consumed" for complete supply chain traceability.

## Query Design Reasoning

**Q1**: Search by ingredient name (case-insensitive) since users likely search "Seasoning Blend" rather than knowing ingredient IDs. Shows all supplier versions with active formulations.

**Q2**: Filters for quantity > 0 and groups by ingredient/supplier for actionable expiry reporting.

**Q3**: Includes manufacturer/supplier names for ownership clarity and aggregates ingredient availability across all batches.

**Q4**: Compares total production to standard batch size for "nearly-out-of-stock" determination as defined in requirements.

**Q5**: Includes nesting violation detection via EXISTS subquery to validate the one-level composition constraint.

**Q6**: Calculates ingredient cost contribution (quantity × unit cost) for complete production cost traceability.

## Constraints Not Captured in E-R Notation

**One-Level Composition**: Materials in compound ingredients cannot themselves have materials (no grandchildren in hierarchy).

**Lot Number Format**: INGREDIENT_BATCH follows "ingredientId-supplierId-batchId"; PRODUCT_BATCH follows "productId-manufacturerId-batchId".

**Non-Overlapping Formulations**: Same ingredient cannot have overlapping effective date ranges.

**90-Day Expiration Rule**: Ingredient expiration must be ≥ received_date + 90 days.

**Role-Entity Mapping**: Users with role='MANUFACTURER' must have MANUFACTURER record; users with role='SUPPLIER' must have SUPPLIER record.

**Active Recipe Constraint**: Only one recipe plan per product can have is_active = TRUE.
